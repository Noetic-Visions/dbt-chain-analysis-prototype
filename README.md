# Getting Started

1. Refer to the `plans/base-plan.md` to get a broad overview of the plan for this prototype.
2. This is then factored out into separate plans for separation of concerns:

    1. file-structure-plan.md
    2. langgraph-agent-plan.md 
    3. database-persistence-plan.md
    4. chainlit-ui-plan.md

These plans serve as an initial starting point (a warm start), but are expected to undergo several iterations of revision.
